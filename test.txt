The Fruit of Strife, of Feuds of Old: Aphrodite Holding an Apple
Residing in the quiet halls of the AUB Archaeological Museum, resting in the beautiful corner of Greco-Roman antiquities, is a figure that transcends time—a small, unassuming terracotta statuette that speaks of love, power, and beauty entwined. It is Aphrodite, the goddess whose name is a song on the tongues of poets and a whisper in the dreams of lovers. Leaning elegantly on a pillar, she holds an apple, a fruit that once ignited the flames of the Trojan War and altered the fates of gods and mortals alike (Figure 1). This artifact is not merely an object of admiration; it is a portal to the myth-laden world of the Hellenistic period, where art and storytelling ¬¬wove together the fabric of human experience.
1. Description 
The figurine is a relic of the Hellenistic era, likely originating from the lands of Anatolia, a region in modern-day Turkey known as a cultural crossroads connecting the civilizations of Greece, Persia, and the Levant (Figure 2). This region was historically significant for its diverse influences and innovations in art, particularly during the Hellenistic period, as it became a melting pot following Alexander the Great's conquests. Crafted in a style reminiscent of Tanagra figurines–small terracotta statues popular in Boeotia, Greece, that typically depicted everyday women or mythological figures with intricate drapery and casual poses–it captures Aphrodite in a moment of serene triumph. Her slender form is draped in a flowing garment that teases rather than conceals, embodying her famed tantalizing allure. A faint trace of red lingers on her hair and hand, a ghost of the vibrant hues that once brought her to life.  This creation is more than an artistic endeavor; it is a symbol steeped in myth. The apple she cradles is no ordinary fruit—it is the golden apple of discord, the prize awarded to the goddess deemed fairest by Paris, the shepherd prince of Troy. This choice, driven by the promise of love, ignited a war that would echo throughout history. Aphrodite’s charm here is not just a celebration of beauty but a reminder of its potent and often perilous power.
2. History of Making
The Aphrodite figurine reflects an artistic evolution spanning millennia, emerging as part of the Hellenistic era’s distinct cultural and technical achievements. Prior to this period, art in the Bronze and early Iron Ages leaned heavily on geometric designs and symbolic abstraction, with figures crafted from metal or clay. These early works, such as the Cycladic figurines (Figure 3) or Mycenaean idols (Figure 4), prioritized ritualistic and communal functions, favoring stylized features that conveyed identity or power over naturalistic representation. However, the Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE) marked a dramatic shift. Following the conquests of Alexander the Great, the blending of Greek, Persian, Egyptian, and Anatolian cultures catalyzed a new emphasis on realism and individuality. Artists sought to humanize the divine, imbuing their works with emotion and movement, while maintaining the distinct Greek ideal of beauty. Terracotta figurines became a preferred medium for this expression, valued for their affordability and malleability. These figures, like Aphrodite Holding an Apple, were typically created using molds for mass production, allowing artisans to replicate popular themes such as domestic deities or mythological narratives with intricate details.
Other figurines of the era, such as the Tanagra figurines from Boeotia, depict women in daily life, elegantly draped and poised, embodying the era’s fascination with beauty and domesticity. The Aphrodite figurine aligns with these trends but adds a mythological dimension. Her casual posture, delicate features, and golden apple reflect both the artistic finesse of the era and its fascination with storytelling. This figure, crafted for personal devotion or decoration, served as a conduit for engaging with Aphrodite’s divine attributes, particularly her roles in beauty, love, and mythological rivalry.

The figurine’s creation reflects the technical advancements of its time. Artisans molded terracotta in two halves, joining the pieces and refining the surface by hand before firing. A thin slip coating allowed for vibrant post-firing paint, remnants of which can still be seen on Aphrodite’s hair and hands. These figures, often displayed in household shrines, were intimate, tangible connections to the divine. The myth of the Judgment of Paris, represented by the golden apple, underscores the cultural significance of this figurine, intertwining personal devotion with shared mythological heritage.
From Public Grandeur to Intimate Devotion: A Comparison with the Venus Genetrix
The Venus Genetrix (Figure 5), a statue from the Roman era currently residing in the Louvre Museum, is recognized as a depiction of Venus in her role as the progenitor of the Romans. A replica of a lost Greek original, it was commissioned by Julius Caesar for the Temple of Venus Genetrix in 46 BCE, aligning the goddess with his family’s claimed divine lineage through her son Aeneas. The statue portrays Venus draped in a finely sculpted garment, her posture both regal and inviting. The fabric’s cascades create a sense of movement and realism. 
Crafted from marble, it exudes durability and splendor, which emphasize its role in public worship and political propaganda. The material’s brilliance and longevity symbolize the enduring power of the Roman state, contrasting sharply with the terracotta of the Aphrodite figurine, which was more modest in material and purpose. 
This is observed upon comparing them in shape and size, as the Venus Genetrix stands life-sized or larger, intended to dominate the temple space and command reverence, whereas our figurine is diminutive and portable, suggesting its use for personal devotion. While the Venus Genetrix embodies the grandeur of public veneration, the Aphrodite figurine offers a personal and narrative-driven connection to the goddess, focusing specifically on her role in the Judgment of Paris. 
Also, the Venus Genetrix served as both a religious icon and a symbol of Roman imperial power. In contrast, the AUB Aphrodite, with her golden apple, underscores her influence in love and mythology rather than statecraft. Despite their differences, these artifacts demonstrate the cultural adaptability of Venus/Aphrodite’s image, tailored to suit both private devotion and public grandeur, which invites us to explore her representation across different cultures.
A Celebration of Sensuality: The Aphrodite of Knidos
Sculpted by Praxiteles in the 4th century BCE, the Aphrodite of Knidos (Figure 6) is one of the most iconic depictions of the goddess, and is widely regarded as the first life-sized representation of the female nude in Western art. This revolutionary depiction merged divinity with human sensuality, portraying Aphrodite in a moment of vulnerability as she prepares to bathe. Her pose, with one hand covering herself, conveys a duality of sensuality and modesty, which became a defining feature of Aphrodite’s iconography. Standing at approximately 2 meters tall, she was designed to be viewed and revered in a sacred setting, in contrast to our beloved figurine’s intimate scale, which suited personal and household veneration. 
Additionally, the Aphrodite of Knidos was carved from Parian marble, known for its translucency and purity, lending the statue a lifelike quality that terracotta could not achieve. While the Knidian Aphrodite’s material reflects the wealth and sophistication of its patron city, the AUB figurine’s terracotta medium represents a democratized form of artistry, available to a broader audience.
Functionally, the Aphrodite of Knidos served as a religious and cultural symbol, representing the city’s prestige and its connection to the divine. Her nudity, a bold artistic choice, invited viewers to contemplate both her divine beauty and her humanity. The original statue even stood in the open-air temple at Knidos, allowing admirers to walk around and appreciate its beauty from all angles. In contrast, the AUB figurine, with its golden apple and casual posture, tells a specific mythological story tied to the Judgment of Paris. 
These two representations of Aphrodite, though vastly different in scale, material, and purpose, highlight the goddess’s enduring appeal across centuries and cultures. The Aphrodite of Knidos captures the grandeur of divine beauty, setting the standard for classical sculpture, while the AUB Aphrodite emphasizes storytelling and accessibility, bringing the goddess closer to the hearts of her followers.
A Monument to Fertility and Survival: The Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük
Shifting across millennia to the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük (Figure 7), we encounter a figurine rooted in a vastly different cultural context. Dating to approximately 6000 BCE, this clay sculpture depicts a notably larger and bulkier female figure seated on a throne. With her exaggerated curves, which were key themes in a Neolithic society dependent on successful harvests and healthy reproduction, she symbolizes fertility and abundance. By contrast, our Aphrodite is slender, her proportions adhering to the idealized beauty of the Hellenistic period. The difference in their shapes reflects the distinct priorities of their respective cultures: one rooted in the necessities of survival, the other in aesthetic and mythological celebration. 
Materially, the Seated Woman is made from unglazed clay, a raw and earthy medium befitting its utilitarian and ritualistic origins. Its simplicity underscores its communal purpose, aligning with the everyday lives of the Çatalhöyük people. The Aphrodite, crafted from refined terracotta, was a product of sophisticated Hellenistic artistry. The addition of slip coatings and traces of paint on the figurine reveals an emphasis on visual appeal, contrasting with the functional plainness of the Çatalhöyük piece.
Functionally, they are worlds apart. While both figurines share a connection to femininity and divinity, they encapsulate entirely different cultural expressions. The Seated Woman speaks of survival, community, and the cyclical nature of life. She symbolizes stability and continuity, both of which are themes vital to the survival of early sedentary societies. Together, they highlight the evolution of artistic and cultural values, from the Neolithic reverence for fertility to the Hellenistic celebration of beauty and myth.

Imagine if, an apple gold: An Interpretive Poem of Hypotheticals 
1. Imagine if, an apple gold
untouched by strife, by feuds of old
Lay cradled in arms, soft as night
of Aphrodite, beautiful as morning light
5. No banquet halls, no whispers cold
No tales of envy, of rivalry bold
No bitter war, no jealous flame
Her love unbound by need for fame
9. No pillar fades to dust and sand
No need for gods to take a stand
The apple’s glow, a gentle guide
To bind the hearts it could divide
13. The hands that grasp, the hearts that seek,
No longing voice, no spirit weak,
For in its shine, all wounds would heal,
No falsehoods whispered, none to steal.
17. Through mortal hands, its path would weave,
A gift of peace for those who grieve.
No blades would clash, no city would fall,
Its gold would shine for one and all.
21. In calm, it rests within her palm,
A symbol soft, a sacred charm,
No strife, no battle, no cruel fate,
No waiting time for hearts to break.
25. The gods themselves might smile and weep,
For in this moment, all would sleep,
The apple's glow a sacred flame,
To lift the world, to break the chains.
29. And so, her sculptor’s craft would speak,
Of love that’s strong, of strength that’s meek.
A goddess not of fractured lore,
But beauty’s light, forevermore.
